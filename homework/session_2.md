# Homework: Session 2

## Question 1

I have a list of things I need to buy from my supermarket of choice. 

```python
shopping_list = [
    "oranges",
    "cat food",
    "sponge cake",
    "long-grain rice",
    "cheese board",
]


print(shopping_list[1])

```

I want to know what the first thing I need to buy is. However, when I run the program it shows me a different answer to what I was expecting?

What is the mistake? How do I fix it?


## Question 2

Your boss really likes calculating VAT on their purchases. It is their favourite hobby. They've written this code to calculate VAT and need your help to fix it.

```python
def calculate_vat(amount):
    amount * 1.2


total = calculate_vat(100)
print(total)
```  

When your boss runs the program they get the following output:

```
None
```

Your boss expects the program to output the value `120`. What is wrong? How do you fix it?
