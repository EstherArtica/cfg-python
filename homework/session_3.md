# Task 1

Create a program that tells you whether or not you need an umbrella when you leave the house.

The program should:
1. Ask you if it is raining using `raw_input()`
1. If the input is 'y', it should output 'Take an umbrella'
1. If the input is 'n', it should output 'You don't need an umbrella

# Task 2



# Task 3

This program will pretend to make bicycles. It will output the colour of each bicycle. Every fifth bicycle should be red, all other bicycles should be blue.

The program should:
1. Use a for loop to repeat 30 times
1. Output the bicycle's number and colour
1. If the number of the bicycle divides perfectly by 5, the colour should be red

**Hint:** Try using `bicycle_number % 5 == 0` to work out if the bicycle should be red.
