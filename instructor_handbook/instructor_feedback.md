Things to change:
- Use PyCharm (command-line is difficult for beginners)
- Move user input into the first session
- Mention int(), bool() in the user input section
- Move command-line/git session after Flask and APIs
- API keys should be kept private
- Use examples of import/pip before moving onto Flask
- Reading/writing to files
- Lists does not cover a lot of fundametal stuff (e.g. .append(), joining lists)
- Dictionaries are never mentioned
- Need more frequent and smaller exercises
- Homework that reflects/reinforces what was learned in the session
- Separate instructions to use command-line if they want to learn
- Extension exercises when students make faster progress 
- Guidance and useful resources (e.g. API tutorials) for projects
- Data analysis
- Windows, Mac and Linux
