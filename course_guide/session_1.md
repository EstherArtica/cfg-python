## Why Python?


What is a program?


### Your First Python Program



### PyCharm

When writing Python programs there are a lot of programs you can use. Some developers like to use text editors like Sublime Text or Atom, others prefer powerful (yet complicated) editors like Vim or Emacs. For this course you will be writing and running your Python programs with PyCharm.

PyCharm is an editor that is designed specifically for Python. It comes with lots of built-in tools that help you work with Python. For example it can highlight typos in your code and can run your programs in a couple of clicks.
