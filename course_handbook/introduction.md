# 0. Introduction

Welcome to the first session of the Code First: Girls Python course! I'm really gald that you can be here.

Over the next eight weeks you're going to learn about a programming language called Python. You'll cover the basics of programming with Python, try a few programming challenges, build a project with a few team mates, and hopefully have some fun along the way.

Never written a program before in your life? No problem. The course is for complete beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Through the course we'll guide you to build up your knowledge and confidence of programming. 

The course is split up into eight sessions. The first four sessions are focussed entirely on introducing Python. Your instructors will introduce core concepts to you and support you through a series of programming exercises. 

The course handbook is here to support you, providing written explanations of what you learn in each session. It also has some extra useful bits of info if you want to go into more depth.

There's also optional homework, which is designed to reinforce what you've learned in the taught sessions.

The final four sessions are all dedicated to your team projects. You'll work in groups of two or three people to create simple applications. Focussing on a project is a great way to develop your programming skills. In the final week you'll get the opportunity to present your projects to the other teams and maybe win a prize.

This part of the course handbook includes a basic introduction to what programming is and explains how to set up your computer ready for the first session. There's also a brief overview of what you'll learn in each session.

## Why Python?

There are lots of really great programming languages out there. You may have hear of ones like Java, Ruby, JavaScript (weirdly unrelated to Java), and C. They're all languages (just like human languages such as English and French), but instead of being used to communicate from one person to another, they're used to communicate instructions to a computer.

All languages have a set of rules that specify how you write them. Each language has different rules, but there are some core concepts that are shared between them.

So what's so special about Python? 

Python has a lot going for it. Firstly, Python is designed to be readable. The people who design the Python language have put a lot of care and effort this (so say thanks if you ever see them). One of the benefits of this is that there is a gentler learning curve for beginners compared to some other languages.

Secondly, Python has a large number of third-party libraries. "What's a library?" I hear you ask. In basic terms, a library is a collection of code that other people have written that you can reuse. This saves you a lot of time as you don't have to write that bit of the code yourself. 

In Python there are libraries that are designed to build websites, analyse large amounts of data, draw pictures, hack into computers, make a velociraptor appear, and many more.

Finally, Python is a very popular language. It's used in a diverse areas like science, machine learning, finance, motion pictures and many more. The skills that you learn as a beginner are a fundamental part of any career that uses Python. 


## Setup

This part of the guide will explain how to install the software required for the course. It will show you how to install:

- Python 3
- PyCharm Community Edition
- Git

I'll also show you how to create a new PyCharm project and test that everything is installed OK.

### Python 3

### PyCharm

When writing Python programs there are a lot of programs you can use. Some developers like to use text editors like Sublime Text or Atom, others prefer powerful (yet complicated) editors like Vim or Emacs. For this course you will be writing and running your Python programs with PyCharm.

PyCharm is an editor that is designed specifically for Python. It comes with lots of built-in tools that help you work with Python (for example it can highlight typos in your code).
