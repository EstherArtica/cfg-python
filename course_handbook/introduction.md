# Introduction

Welcome to the first session of the Code First: Girls Python course! I'm really gald that you can be here.

Over the next eight weeks you're going to learn about a programming language called Python. You'll cover the basics of programming with Python, try a few programming challenges, build a project with a few team mates, and hopefully have some fun along the way.

Never written a program before in your life? No problem. The course is for complete beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Through the course we'll guide you to build up your knowledge and confidence of programming. 

The course is split up into eight sessions. The first four sessions are focussed entirely on introducing Python. Your instructors will introduce core concepts to you and support you through a series of programming exercises. 

The course handbook is here to support you, providing written explanations of what you learn in each session. It also has some extra useful bits of info if you want to go into more depth.

There's also optional homework, which is designed to reinforce what you've learned in the taught sessions.

The final four sessions are all dedicated to your team projects. You'll work in groups of two or three people to create simple applications. Focussing on a project is a great way to develop your programming skills. In the final week you'll get the opportunity to present your projects to the other teams and maybe win a prize.

You can see a brief overview of what you'll learn in each session below. 

In the next part of the handook you'll see how to set up your computer ready for the first session.  


## Course Content 

### Session 1

The first session is a gentle introduction to the basics of Python. Through short exercises you will become familiar with variables, data-types, and the PyCharm IDE. You are also taught how to read error messages, which will help you fix your programs when they aren't working.

1. Running Python with files and the console
1. Data-types (Integers, Floats and Strings)
1. Maths operations
1. Understanding error messages
1. Variables
1. User input

### Session 2

The second session focuses on building problem solving skills through drawing. The Turtle library is used to create basic drawings with Python. Using this library you will be introduced to lists, loops, and functions.

1. Importing other libraries
1. Problem solving with Turtle
1. Lists
1. For Loops
1. Functions

### Session 3

In the third session you will learn about logic and dictionaries. By using logical comparators and if statements, you can automate basic decision making in your programs. 

1. Logical comparators
1. If statements
1. Dictionaries

### Session 4

The fourth session is the last session that focuses only on Python. You will have covered the core concepts of programming in the first three sessions. In this session you are introduced to working with third-party libraries and APIs.

1. Pip package manager
1. APIs
1. Flask and Jinja

### Session 5

Session five is about for your group projects. In the first half of the session you will be given an introduction to the most essential parts of git. In the second half you will form a group and start planning you projects and set achievable goals.

1. Git
1. Planning your project

### Session 6-7

In sessions six and seven you will work as part of your team to build your project.

1. Project

### Session 8

In the final session you'll have a short amount of time to make final changes to your team projects. In the second half your team will present your project to the other students.

1. Project
1. Presentations
