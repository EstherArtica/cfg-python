<h1>0. Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the first session of the Code First: Girls Python course! I'm really gald that you can be here.</p>

<p>Over the next eight weeks you're going to learn about a programming language called Python. You'll cover the basics of programming with Python, try a few programming challenges, build a project with a few team mates, and hopefully have some fun along the way.</p>

<p>Never written a program before in your life? No problem. The course is for complete beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Through the course we'll guide you to build up your knowledge and confidence of programming. </p>

<p>The course is split up into eight sessions. The first four sessions are focussed entirely on introducing Python. Your instructors will introduce core concepts to you and support you through a series of programming exercises. </p>

<p>The course handbook is here to support you, providing written explanations of what you learn in each session. It also has some extra useful bits of info if you want to go into more depth.</p>

<p>There's also optional homework, which is designed to reinforce what you've learned in the taught sessions.</p>

<p>The final four sessions are all dedicated to your team projects. You'll work in groups of two or three people to create simple applications. Focussing on a project is a great way to develop your programming skills. In the final week you'll get the opportunity to present your projects to the other teams and maybe win a prize.</p>

<p>This part of the course handbook includes a basic introduction to what programming is and explains how to set up your computer ready for the first session. There's also a brief overview of what you'll learn in each session.</p>

<h2>Why Python?</h2>

<p>There are lots of really great programming languages out there. You may have hear of ones like Java, Ruby, JavaScript (weirdly unrelated to Java), and C. They're all languages (just like human languages such as English and French), but instead of being used to communicate from one person to another, they're used to communicate instructions to a computer.</p>

<p>All languages have a set of rules that specify how you write them. Each language has different rules, but there are some core concepts that are shared between them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Programming Language:</strong> A language with a set of rules that communicates instructions to a computer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what's so special about Python? </p>

<p>Python has a lot going for it. Firstly, Python is designed to be readable. The people who design the Python language have put a lot of care and effort this (so say thanks if you ever see them). One of the benefits of this is that there is a gentler learning curve for beginners compared to some other languages.</p>

<p>Secondly, Python has a large number of third-party libraries. "What's a library?" I hear you ask. In basic terms, a library is a collection of code that other people have written that you can reuse. This saves you a lot of time as you don't have to write that bit of the code yourself. </p>

<p>In Python there are libraries that are designed to build websites, analyse large amounts of data, draw pictures, hack into computers, make a velociraptor appear, and many more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Library:</strong> Reusable collection of code that someone else has written which you can use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Python is a very popular language. It's used in a diverse areas like science, machine learning, finance, motion pictures and many more. The skills that you learn as a beginner are a fundamental part of any career that uses Python. </p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>This part of the guide will explain how to install the software required for the course. It will show you how to install:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>PyCharm Community Edition</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll also show you how to create a new PyCharm project and test that everything is installed OK.</p>

<h3>Python 3</h3>

<h3>PyCharm</h3>

<p>When writing Python programs there are a lot of programs you can use. Some developers like to use text editors like Sublime Text or Atom, others prefer powerful (yet complicated) editors like Vim or Emacs. For this course you will be writing and running your Python programs with PyCharm.</p>

<p>PyCharm is an editor that is designed specifically for Python. It comes with lots of built-in tools that help you work with Python (for example it can highlight typos in your code).</p>

<h2>Your First Python Program</h2>

<p>Time to write your first Python program! </p>

<p>To write and run your first Python program follow each of the four steps below. Refer back to these steps whenever you want as you'll need to use them throughout the course. </p>

<p><strong>Step One:</strong> First let's create a new Python file in Pycharm. </p>

<p>Right click on the <code>cfg_python</code> folder on the Project Tool Window and select <code>New &gt; Python File</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> In the window enter <code>hello</code> as the name and click <code>OK</code>. PyCharm will automatically add the <code>.py</code> for you.</p>

<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Now that you've create your file, let's add some Python code. In the file type the following:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello, World!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Make sure that <code>print</code> has no capital letters. There should also be two speech marks (one either side of the <code>Hello, World</code> text) and an opening and closing bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now that you've written your Python code, it's time to run it!</p>

<p>To run you program, right click anywhere in the file and click on <code>Run hello</code>. You should see PyCharm's Run window appear with the text <code>Hello, World!</code>. </p>

<p>Congratulations! You've just run your first Python program. </p>

<p>That's cool and everything, but what's going on?</p>

<p>In your program there are two main bits: </p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>print()</code> bit</li>
<li>The <code>'Hello, World!'</code> bit that's inside of the <code>print()</code> bit.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>print()</code> bit is an example of a <em>function</em>. A function does a specific task. The task of the <code>print()</code> function is to display some data value to you, the programmer. If you removed the <code>print()</code> your program would still run OK, it just wouldn't display the output to you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Function:</strong> a pre-written set of instructions to complete a certain task</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case the data value that is being displayed is <code>'Hello, World!'</code>. This is an example of a <em>string</em>. You'll learn about strings in more depth very soon. For the time you just need to know that strings are used to represent text in Python. </p>

<p>By changing the text in the string, you change the value that is output. For example I've changed the value of the string to output a description of my favourite socks:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;My favourite socks have blue diamonds&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Try changing the value to whatever you want!</p>

<h2>Numbers and Operators</h2>

<p>When writing programs you'll often want to work with numbers and do calculations on those numbers. That's what this section is all about. I'll introduce you to two (yes, two!) types of numbers and a bunch of different operators.</p>

<p>The first type of numbers you'll get to know are <em>Integers</em>. Integers are whole numbers without decimal points. For example <code>1</code>, <code>4329884</code> and <code>-63</code> are all integers.</p>

<p>The second type of numbers are called <em>Floats</em>. A float is any number that has a decimal point. For example <code>1.65</code>, <code>82.0</code> and <code>-9.3</code> are all floats. </p>

<p>Before you move on I want to tell you about <em>data types</em>. A data type refers to what kind of thing a piece of data is. For example <code>7</code> has an integer data type and <code>'Hello, World!'</code> has a string data type. </p>

<p>So far you've seen three data types: strings, integers, and floats. You'll cover a few more data types throughout the course. It's important to know what data types you're working with as different data types can have different operations performed on them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Data Type</strong>: The kind of data that determines what values it can be and what operations can be performed with it</p>
  
  <p><strong>Integer:</strong> a Python data type for whole numbers</p>
  
  <p><strong>Float:</strong> a Python data type for decimal numbers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that you've seen the two types of number data, let's take a look at <em>maths operators</em>. </p>

<p>A maths operator combines two number values to calculate a result. For example if I wanted to see the result of adding the integer values <code>5</code> and <code>17</code> together I could use the <em>addition operator</em> (<code>+</code>) like so:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When I run this like of code the value <code>22</code> would be displayed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Maths Operator:</strong> An operation that calculates the result of combining two number values</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can also use float values with the addition operator. Here my code will display the result of adding the float values <code>8.3</code> and <code>10.12</code>:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">8.3</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">10.12</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The value <code>18.42</code> should be displayed when this program is ran.</p>

<p>There are a handful of maths operators in Python. Let's do an exercise to find out how they behave.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Exercise 1.1: Operators in the Python Console</h3>

<p>In this task you will use different maths operators to discover their purpose. You'll also learn about a different way to run Python code using the Python console.</p>

<p>Python has two main ways to run code: files and the console. You've already used files, let's take a look at the console.</p>

<p>When a Python file is run it will start at the top of the file and run each line one at a time. When it reaches the end of the file the program finishes running. The only way for you the programmer to see the output of the program is to use the <code>print()</code> function.</p>

<p>The Python Console is different to files. It immediately shows the result of a line of code without needing to use the <code>print()</code> function.</p>

<p>To view the Python Console, go to the top menu and click <code>View &gt; Tool Window &gt; Python Console</code>. Each line in the Python Console begins with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. You can type Python code in and press enter to run it. The Python Console will immediately show the result. </p>

<p>For example if I enter <code>9 + 3</code> on the Python Console it would look like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="mi">12</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the Python Console console immediatly shows results it is useful for quickly exploring how new bits of code work. Files on the other hand are useful when you want to run the same code multiple times.</p>

<p>Let's use the Python Console to explore how different Maths Operators work.</p>

<p>In your Python Console type the following lines of code one at a time:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="mi">8</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">9</span>
<span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mf">5.0</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Look at the output for each line. What do you think each operator does? Are there any outputs that you didn't expect?</p>

<hr />

<p>[EXPLAIN EACH OF THE OPERATORS USED IN THE EXERCISE]</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Labels</p>

<p>Variables work with all data-types</p>

<h2>String Formatting</h2>

<p>There a few different ways to do string formatting in Python</p>

<p>[F-STRINGS]</p>

<h2>User Input</h2>

<p>If tkinter isn't installed on Linux:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install python3-tk 
</code></pre></div>

<h1>Session 3.</h1>

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

<p>Conmparisons are all about checking if something is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. This has many applications in programming. Is the password a user has just entered correct? Is there enough money in my account to buy a pair of socks? Can I fit another jelly bean in my mouth?</p>

<p>Notice how all of the above examples are yes or no questions. In Python you can represent a yes as a <code>True</code> value and a no as a <code>False</code> value.</p>

<p>The <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> values are both Boolean data types. Named after George Bool, an English Math wizard, Boolean is pronounced like Cool Ian, but with a B.</p>

<p>Like all data types in Python you can use variables to label the values and explain their meaning to other programmers:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">am_i_hungry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">is_it_hot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>On thing to note is that the values <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> should start with a capital letter. If you miss forget to capitalise the value Python will think the value is a variable and you'll get an error like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="nv">i_am_skiing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name <span class="s1">&#39;true&#39;</span> is not defined
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Checking Stuff is True or False</h3>

<p>A lot of the time you won't know if something is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> until you check it. This is where comparators come in. </p>

<p>In their most basic form comparators will compare one value with another, then will return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on the result.</p>

<p>Say I have five forks and six friends, and I want to know if I have enough forks to throw a dinner party. To do this I can check whether the number of forks I have is greater than my number of friends:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">forks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="n">friends</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>

<span class="n">enough_forks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">forks</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">friends</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;You have enough forks: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">enough_forks</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output of this program is <code>You have enough forks: False</code></p>

<p>The part of the program that does the comparison is <code>forks &gt;= friends</code>. The <code>&gt;=</code> bit compares if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.</p>

<p>The result of this case is returned and I use the <code>enough_forks</code> variable to remember this result. The reason that the result is <code>False</code> in this case is because <code>5</code> is not greater than or equal to <code>6</code>.</p>

<p>I either need more forks or fewer friends.</p>

<p>After a long deliberation I decided to buy one more fork (it was a tought decision):</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">forks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="n">friends</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>

<span class="n">enough_forks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">forks</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">friends</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;You have enough forks: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">enough_forks</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the output of the program is <code>You have enough forks: True</code></p>

<p>The value of <code>forks</code> is now <code>6</code>, which is equal to the value of the <code>friends</code> variable. So when the <code>forks &gt;= friends</code> comparison is made, the value of <code>enough_forks</code> is set to <code>True</code>.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Do I have enough eggs to make a really big omlette?</h3>

<p>My dinner party is going to be a huge success. My friends will all love how they don't have to share cutlery. I just need to decide what to cook.</p>

<p>To really wow my friends I'm planning to cook a really big omlette. But do I have enough eggs?</p>

<p>I have 17 edible eggs in my fridge. I estimate that I will need three eggs of my friends (remember that I have exactly 6 friends).</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">eggs_in_fridge</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">17</span>

<span class="n">friends</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="n">required_eggs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">friends</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>

<span class="n">enough_eggs</span> <span class="o">=</span> 

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;The party omlette has enough eggs: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">enough_eggs</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your task is to finish my program that calculates whether I have enough eggs for my party omlette. To do this you need to check whether <code>eggs_is_fridge</code> is greater than or equal to <code>required_eggs</code>. The result should be assigned to the <code>enough_eggs</code> variable.</p>

<p>Be creative with the wording of the output for extra points. Just makes sure it shows the result as <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>

<h3>More Ways to Compare Stuff</h3>

<p>In the last example I checked whether the number of forks was greater than or equal to the number of friends I have.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly the <code>&gt;=</code> comparator in Python is called the <code>greater than or equal</code> comparator.</p>

<p>There are other comparators in Python. Let's take a tour of the exciting line-up of comparators that Python has available.</p>

<h4>Equal To (==)</h4>

<p>First up is the <code>==</code> or <code>equal to</code> comparator. This nifty little comparator checks whether two values are equal. </p>

<p>Let's say I've built a chair and need to check it has exactly four legs:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">required_legs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">legs_i_made</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="n">right_amount_of_legs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">required_legs</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">legs_i_made</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">right_amount_of_legs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output of this program is <code>False</code>. The values <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> are not the same so the the result of the comparison is <code>False</code>. Oh no I have too many legs on my chair. People are going to give me weird looks.</p>

<p>I've hatily cut off one of the legs with a saw:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">required_legs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">legs_i_made</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>

<span class="n">right_amount_of_legs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">required_legs</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">legs_i_made</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">right_amount_of_legs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the result is <code>True</code> as the values <code>4</code> and <code>4</code> are the same.</p>

<p>Notice how the <code>equal to</code> comparator is two equals signs <code>==</code>. This looks similar, but is in fact very different, to when you use a single equals sign <code>=</code> to create a variable.</p>

<p>Always remember to use a single equals sign <code>=</code> when assigning a value to a variable and a double equals sign <code>==</code> when comparing two values.</p>

<h3>Exercise: I'm on chair building spree</h3>

<p>I'm really into building chairs now. If I don't find a way to stop myself I'll have too many chairs for my friends to sit on. They won't know what to do.</p>

<p>Let's write a program to check I have exactly four chairs.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">chairs_made</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">desired_chairs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>

<span class="n">stop_making_chairs</span> <span class="o">=</span> 

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Stop making chairs right now: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stop_making_chairs</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While I hammer and glue bits of wood, it's your job to finish this program. </p>

<p>You'll need to check <code>chairs_made</code> is equal to <code>desired_chairs</code>. The result of this comparison should be assigned to the <code>stop_making_chairs</code> variable. Only then will I know when to stop making chairs.</p>

<h4>Checking Things Are Not the Same (!=)</h4>

<p>The <code>equal to</code> comparator has an inverse version of itself, known as the <code>not equal to</code> comparator. </p>

<p>In short the <code>not equal to</code> will evaluate to <code>False</code> is the two values being compared are the same. It will be <code>True</code> when the two compared values are different. This is the opposite of the <code>equal to</code> comparator.</p>

<p>The <code>equal to</code> and <code>not equal to</code> comparators can be used to compare strings and number (integers and floats) data types.</p>

<p>Here I'm checking that the film my friend wants to watch is not The Shape of Water (I can't watch it with other people, I cry too much at the end)</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">friends_film_choice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;The Shape of Water&#39;</span>
<span class="n">film_that_makes_me_cry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;The Shape of Water&#39;</span>

<span class="n">no_crying</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">friends_film_choice</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">film_that_makes_me_cry</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;You will not cry at this film: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">no_crying</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Uh-oh, looks like they've chosen the film that will make me cry so the output is <code>You will not cry at this film: False</code></p>

<p>One thing to note is that when comparing strings the comparators are really strict. A single character difference will change the result of the comparison. For example if I only have a capital letter difference between the two strings, they will be compared as totally different:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">friends_film_choice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;the shape of water&#39;</span>
<span class="n">film_that_makes_me_cry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;The Shape of Water&#39;</span>

<span class="n">no_crying</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">friends_film_choice</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">film_that_makes_me_cry</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;You will not cry at this film: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">no_crying</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output will be <code>You will not cry at this film: True</code>, which is strange because as humans we know they're the same thing. Python is strict in these comparisons because in most cases it does actually matter.</p>

<p>There is a way around this. If you remember back to the first session you learned how to change the case of a string with the <code>.lower()</code> method. Using this method you can force both of the strings to be in lower-case, making the comparison consistent with what we expect:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">friends_film_choice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;the shape of water&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">()</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The output is back to what I expected <code>You will not cry at this film: False</code>. That's that sorted. Now I can focus on crying at an artful story of fish-man romance.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Is the omlette safe to eat?</h3>

<p>So that I don't give my friends food poisoning I need to check that the omlette is safe to eat. How am I going to do that? Well, like all of my other problems, with a Python program!</p>

<p>Using my in-depth knowledge of food science, I have determined that a omlette is safe to eat if it is not runny.</p>

<p>I started writing the program, but then the post man arrived to deliver my eBay purchase of a single spoon. He's what I got so far:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">is_runny</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Is the omlette runny? (y/n)&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">is_edible</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>I want you to finish my omlette safety checking program. Don't worry, I trust you. Te worst that could happen is my friends never stop telling the story of how I served them plates of raw eggs at a dinner party.</p>

<p>To finish my program you need to use the <code>not equal</code> comparison. Use this to check the value of <code>is_runny</code> is not equal to <code>'y'</code>. The result of this comparison should be assigned to the <code>is_edible</code> variable.</p>

<p>You'll also need to add output in this format <code>The omlette is safe to eat: True</code>.</p>

<h4>Let's Cover Greater, Less and Their Variants at the Same Time</h4>

<p>Our tour of comparators is realy picking up pace. We're looping back on ourselves and covering the <code>greater than or equal to</code> comparator and its close siblings.</p>

<p>The <code>greater than or equal to</code> comparator has a twin. Their parents named it <code>less than or equal to</code> and it looks like <code>&lt;=</code>. Like all other comparators it compares two values. In this case is checks whether the value on the left is smaller than or the same as the one on the right.</p>

<p>I'm like average levels of tall. It's only a problem when I'm visiting really small houses and Hobbiton.</p>

<p>Let's see if I can fit through a door:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">182.1</span>
<span class="n">door_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">190</span>

<span class="n">can_fit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">door_height</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;I can walk through this door: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">can_fit</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output is <code>I can walk through this door: True</code>. Nice. No bending over for me.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, here comes another door!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">182.1</span>
<span class="n">door_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">182.0</span>

<span class="n">can_fit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">door_height</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;I can walk through this door: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">can_fit</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time the output is <code>I can walk through this door: False</code>. Ouch.</p>

<p>There are another two comparators that you need to know about. The <code>less than</code> and <code>greater than</code> comparators. They're just like the <code>less than or equal to</code> and <code>greater than or equal to</code> comparators, but they won't return <code>True</code> if the compared values are the same.</p>

<p>The <code>greater than</code> comparator looks like this <code>&gt;</code> and the <code>less than</code> comparator looks like this <code>&lt;</code>. You might get direction of these mixed up from time to time. I found it was helpful to image that the symbol is a shark's mouth and it wants to eat the larger number.</p>

<p>The final thing to note about the four comparators (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>) is that they work with number data types (integers and floats), but don't work with strings. It's easy for Python to know if <code>5</code> is greater than <code>6</code>, but not so much for Python to know if <code>"Air freshener"</code> is greater than <code>"Tomato"</code>. </p>

<h3>Exercise: How good was the party out of 5 stars</h3>

<p>I've spent months preparing for this dinner party. I've counted numerous eggs multiple times, poured my blood sweat and tears into chairs that are definitely safe to sit on (don't let anyone tell you otherwise), and invested in a new spoon.</p>

<p>When the night is over I want to check that all my hard work paid off. That's right, I'm going to send my friends a survey.</p>

<p>Like all good reviews my dinner party will be rated using 1 to 5 stars. After I've received the ratings I will be heart broken if I receive 3 or less stars.</p>

<p>It's your job to write the program that will tell me that my friends rated my party more than 3 stars. Here you go. I've started it for you.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">friends_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">three_stars</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>

<span class="n">good_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>Choose a comparator to decide how you want to compare my <code>friends_rating</code> to <code>three_stars</code>. Remember a score of <code>3</code> or lower is bad, whereas a score of more than <code>3</code> is good.</p>

<p>Make sure you output the result with a sentence.</p>

<h4>Checking Something is in a List</h4>

<p>Our final stop on our tour of comparators is a special one. It's the <code>in</code> comparator.</p>

<p>This one is special in that it can check whether one value is in a list of other values. </p>

<p>I have a bunch of things in my backpack. I need to check if I have a pen in there:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">backpack</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;laptop&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;keys&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pen&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;notebook&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">has_pen</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pen&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">backpack</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;I have a pen: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">has_pen</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There is a value <code>'pen'</code> in the <code>backpack</code> list, so the output is <code>I have a pen: True</code></p>

<p>The <code>in</code> comparator can also check if one string is inside another string. </p>

<p>I want to check if a name has the letter <code>'e'</code> in it:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Francis Bacon&#39;</span>

<span class="n">has_e</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;e&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">name</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;{} has an e in it: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">has_e</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The output for this is <code>Francis Bacon has an e in it: False</code>. There is no letter <code>'e'</code> in <code>'Francis Bacon</code>' so the result is <code>False</code>.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Guest List</h3>

<p>My dinner parties have become very popular. People line up around the block to eat my omlette and use one of my six forks.</p>

<p>To restrict who comes into my dinner parties, I need to use a guest list.</p>

<p>I've started writing a program to check the guest list:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">raw_input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Please enter name: &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">guests</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;Sarah&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Joan&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;James&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Niamh&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">on_the_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>You need to finish the guest list program. Using the value in the <code>name</code> variable, check that it's in the <code>guests</code> list. Put the result in <code>on_the_list</code> variable and print the result.</p>

<h3>Comparing Multiple Things and Checking Opposites</h3>

<p>Comparators compare two things. Is one thing greater than another? Are these two values the same?</p>

<p>Quite often you'll want to combine multiple comparisons together. For example a friend asks me if I want to see a film at the cinema next Wednesday. I would want to check two things: Am I available on Wednesday; and have I already seen the film?</p>

<p>Boolean operators in Python allow you to join multiple Boolean values together and return a single result. The <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> Boolean operators are used for this, which you will see in a moment.</p>

<p>There is also a third Boolean operator, <code>not</code>, which behaves differently. It swaps <code>True</code> for <code>False</code> values and <code>False</code> for <code>True</code> values. You'll also see this in just a moment. </p>

<h4>and</h4>

<p>The <code>and</code> operator is used to combine two Boolean values into a single result. </p>

<p>I'm about to board a plane flight for my holidays. To get on the flight I need two things: my ticket and my passport. </p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">has_ticket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">has_passport</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">can_fly</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">has_ticket</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">has_passport</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Can fly: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">can_fly</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>and</code> operator goes between two values. In the above example it goes between <code>has_ticket</code> and <code>has_passport</code>. The result of this depends on whether or not both values are <code>True</code>. </p>

<p>In this example both <code>has_ticket</code> and <code>has_passport</code> are <code>True</code> so the result will be <code>True</code>. If either or both of these values were <code>False</code> then the result would be <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>For example if I forgot my passport then I wouldn't be allowed on my flight:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">has_ticket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">has_passport</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>

<span class="n">can_fly</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">has_ticket</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">has_passport</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Can fly: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">can_fly</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the <code>has_passport</code> value is <code>False</code> the result is <code>Can fly: False</code>. Even though the <code>has_ticket</code> value is <code>True</code>, when it is combined with the <code>False</code> value of <code>has_passport</code>, the final result is <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>You can see the different results when you combine different Boolean values with the <code>and</code> operator in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Values</th>
  <th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>True and True</code></td>
  <td><code>True</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>True and False</code></td>
  <td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>False and True</code></td>
  <td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>False and False</code></td>
  <td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The comparators that you covered earlier all return a boolean value, which means they can be combined with Boolean operators.</p>

<p>I want to ride a roller coaster while I'm on holiday. The roller coaster has a minimum height check and costs $2.50 per ride. I need to check I'm tall enough and have enough money.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">cost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">2.5</span>
<span class="n">min_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">152</span>

<span class="n">my_money</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">3.22</span>
<span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">182</span>

<span class="n">can_ride</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">my_money</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">cost</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">my_height</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">min_height</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Can ride the roller coaster: {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">can_ride</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When Python runs this line <code>can_ride = my_money &gt;= cost and my_height &gt;= min_height</code> it does it in several steps. First it runs <code>my_money &gt;= cost</code>, which in this case has the values <code>3.22 &gt;= 2.5</code>. The result is <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Next it checks <code>my_height &gt;= min_height</code>. Substituting in the values you can see <code>182 &gt;= 152</code> also results in <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Python then sees that there is an <code>and</code> operator and know check if both results are <code>True</code>. In this case both results are <code>True</code> so the final result is <code>True</code>, which is assigned to the <code>can_ride</code> variable.</p>

<h4>or</h4>

<p>The <code>or</code> Boolean operator combines two Boolean values into a single result. If at least one of the Boolean values is <code>True</code> then the final result will be <code>True</code>. The only time that the result will be <code>False</code> is if both values are <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>I imagine you're trying to enter an ice-cream shop to buy some delicious and well priced ice-cream. The shop has two doors. To get into the shop only one of the doors needs to be open. If either of the doors or both of the doors is open you can get in.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">door_1_open</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">door_2_open</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>

<span class="n">is_ice_cream_shop_open</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">door_1_open</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">door_2_open</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;I can have some ice-cream {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">is_ice_cream_shop_open</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because door 1 is open, I can get ice-cream. Even though the second door is locked, I can still get into the building for an icy treat.</p>

<p>You can see the result of the different combinations for Boolean values with the <code>or</code> operator in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Values</th>
  <th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>True or True</code></td>
  <td><code>True</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>True or False</code></td>
  <td><code>True</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>False or True</code></td>
  <td><code>True</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>False or False</code></td>
  <td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Just like with the <code>and</code> operator, the <code>or</code> operator can be used with comparators.</p>

<p>To summarise, the <code>and</code> Boolean operator will result in <code>True</code> only if <strong>all</strong> values are <code>True</code>. The <code>or</code> operator will result in <code>True</code> if <em>any</em> values are <code>True</code>.</p>

<h4>not</h4>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Values</th>
  <th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>not True</code></td>
  <td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>not False</code></td>
  <td><code>True</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>Comparators and Boolean operators</p>

<p>Brackets</p>

<h4>Keeping It Clean</h4>

<p>When using operators and comparators together you can actually do a lot in a single line:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">valid_qty</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">12</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Valid qty of flowers {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">valid_qty</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Any idea what the result of that is? No? Me neither. I just wrote that and it takes me quite a while to understand what's going on.</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>

<p>As you progress on your journey as a developer you'll find that being able to work quickly and without simple mistakes is linked to how readable the code is. </p>

<p>Breaking down complex statements like the one above into smaller parts is one way to make the code more descriptive and easier to understand:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span>

<span class="n">at_least_one_flower</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">no_more_than_100_flowers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">100</span>

<span class="n">in_multiples_of_five</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">in_multiples_of_twelve</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">12</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="n">not_too_many_or_few</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">at_least_one_flower</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">no_more_than_100_flowers</span>
<span class="n">correct_multiples</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">in_multiples_of_five</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">in_multiples_of_twelve</span>

<span class="n">valid_qty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">not_too_many_or_few</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">correct_multiples</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Valid qty of flowers {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">valid_qty</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now each part has a named variable that clearly explains the purpose of each comparison before they're all joined into the final result. </p>

<p>I've managed to work out that I need to buy more than <code>0</code> flowers and <code>100</code> or less flowers. I also need to buy the flowers in multiples of <code>5</code> or <code>12</code>. </p>

<p>Although there are more lines, the purpose of each one is clearly explained by the name of the variable. Although it takes me slightly longer to read, it is much faster for me to understand what it is doing and why it is doing it.</p>

<p>We can take this one step further by putting it all together in a function. </p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">valid_qty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">flowers_ordered</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">at_least_one_flower</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">no_more_than_100_flowers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">100</span>

    <span class="n">in_multiples_of_five</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">in_multiples_of_twelve</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flowers_ordered</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">12</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="n">not_too_many_or_few</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">at_least_one_flower</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">no_more_than_100_flowers</span>
    <span class="n">correct_multiples</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">in_multiples_of_five</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">in_multiples_of_twelve</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">not_too_many_or_few</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">correct_multiples</span>


<span class="n">is_valid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">valid_qty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Valid qty of flowers {}&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">is_valid</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now all of my code is in a function it can be reused. It also makes the other parts of my code cleaner as the function name explains what it does concisely. It also means the other parts of the code don't need to know how to do this calculation, so the complexity can be kept hidden away from the code that uses the function.</p>
