# Course Overview

Python
- Wide ecosystem
- Readability it a core principle
- Ideal for beginners and professionals alike

This course teaches the fundamentals, while drawing on the wider Python ecosystem, to give learners a good basic foundation in programming.

The number of topics introduced in this course is amibitous, yet achievable. Priority is given to learning through applied, practical problem solving, instead of a more lecture type approach.

By the end of this course students will be able to: 
- Understand core programming concepts
- Read and write clean Python code
- Break down problems and solve them with code
- Demonstrate independent learning and teamwork

Things included in the course:
- Course slides
- Course handbook
- Session plans for instructors
- Instructor guide

### Sessions

Each session is structured around a particular topic. Short, instructor-led introductions and explanations are followed by closely related exercises. 

Applying programming for practical problem solving is the main focus of the sessions, so more time is dedicated to student exercises than instruction.

The instructor-led parts of the sessions introduce programming concepts through concise explanations and guided examples in Python. The course slides are used to support the instructors by providing:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Definitions of new programming terms
- Descriptions of Python syntax and rules
- Examples that illustrate the current concept
- Common mistakes and solutions

In addition to explaining new concepts, the instructor-led part of the sessions can be used to check student understanding through questioning. 

Care is provided here to make sure that too many concepts are not introduced at once. After each concept is introduced students are given a programming exercise to reinforce their understanding before moving onto the next concept.

Programming exercises are a chance for students to learn through structured problem solving and exploration. Each exercise has a clear and achievable goal and directly follows on from the topic that the instructor has introduced. 

The pedagogical techniques are used in the programming exercises include:

- **Student Pairing:** During exercises, students work in pairs to find solutions. This has multiple benefits. Primarily, by supporting their peers, students can gain a deeper understanding of a topic themselves. It also adds a social element to the sessions and helps students identify who they want to work with on their projects. Finally, it reduces the support burden on instructors, meaning they can more effectively target support to students that are making slower progress.

- **Scaffolding:** At the start of learning something new students often need more support and guidance. As they progress they gain familiarity and confidence, allowing them to take on more challenging tasks. Scaffolding is a technique where lots of support on exercises is offered early on and is gradually decreased as students progress. In other words, exercises start basic and then gradually get more challenging as the session progresses.

- **Differentiation:** Students all learn at different speeds. Some students have the confidence to tackle more challenging problems early on, while others may need more support and guidance. Differentiation is a technique used to tailor exercises to different levels of progress. This can include giving the same task to all students, but providing hints, guided answers or partial solutions to students that need more support and more difficult extension questions to students that have progressed further. Alternatively different tasks that are grouped by difficulty level are given to students and they choose which level they want to attempt.

Following each exercise a solution is provided. The instructor can talk the students through a suggested solution. They can also ask pairs of students to share and explain their solution (or part of it) with the class or in a small group. Solutions to all exercises are available at the end of the course handbook. 


### Course Handbook

The course handbook supplements the course sessions. It covers the same topics and exercises as the course sessions in the same order.



- Course guide
  - More in-depth explanations
  - Common problems
  - Extras topics and exercises not covered in sessions
  - Optional homework
  - Useful project resources
  - Further resources (e.g. blogs, podcasts, online courses, conferences with bursaries)


Explanations:
1. Optional in-depth explanations of course content (useful for helping students that missed a session catch up)
1. Additional topics not covered in the session 


Homework:
1. Reinforces learning from session and helps retention
1. Scaffolded - starts with very structured questions, gradually progresses to harder problems


Project:
- Project planning tips
- How to break down a project into achievable goals
- Useful APIs and links to beginner-friendly tutorials
- Instructors help set objectives early on. This focuses students on a particular problem and narrows the scope of their project to something achievable. 


### Session Plans and Instructor Guide

Session plans provide a concise overview of each session for the instructors
- Main objectives
- Order of teaching and exercises with suggested timings
- Common issues

Intructor guide: 
- General guidance and best practice:
- Techniques: think-pair-share, red/green post-it notes, confidence hands (hold up a number of fingers based on how confident you feel about the topic we've just discussed), count-downs to get attention before talking, give students time to think before answering questions, never ask "DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND??? GOOD", give a pause after asking "ANY QUESTIONS???", hands up if you think the answer is "A" or "B"
This can be through targeted questioning of students where a question is asked to the group and after some thinking a student is picked at random to answer it, choose different students every time to answer questions
