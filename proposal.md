# Code First: Girls - Python Course Proposal

This proposal is for a new version of the Code First: Girls Python course. In brief, this work would improve the structure and content of the course, as well as provide better resources for students and instructors. This document gives an overview of my approach to each of the course resources.

These are the resources that are included in the updated version of the course:

- Student handbook
- Intsructor slides
- Programming exercises and solutions
- Project guidance
- Homework
- Session plans for instructors

The goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of programming with Python. It introduces the core concepts of programming using Python 3. The version of the course that is currently taught uses Python 2.7, which will no longer be available from January 1st 2020.

During each session students are introduced to Python through a combination of instructor-led explanations and programming exercises. Emphasis is put on the development of practical problem solving skills through programming exercises. For each concept introduced by instructors, students complete a corresponding exercise.

Students all learn and make progress at different speeds. Ensuring that the course materials are accessible to all students is a priority of this course. To accomodate for this, exercises are differentiated. For example on certain exercises, students that make faster progress are given additional extension tasks, while students that need more support are provided with additional guidance in the task description. 

Homework directly reinforces the topics covered in each session. Although optional, the homework gives the students an opportunity to strengthen their knowledge and skills through further practice. 

The slides and student handbook cover the same topics and exercises in the same order. The handbook can be used by students to revise or clarify topics covered in the sessions. It also helps students that miss sessions catch up. By providing instructors with standard slides the amount of preparation they have to do is reduced drastically. 

The student handbook also goes into more depth on certain topics not covered in the sessions. For example the lists section covers sorting. This gives students the opportunity to go into further depth if they wish. 

The content of the course has been updated. It ensures that each topic is covered in-depth without any major gaps in key knowledge. For example, list methods and dictionaries are now covered; two topics which are essential for most team projects. Only a couple of topics, such as Heroku, have been removed, but are included as optional content in the course handbook.

Transitioning to open-ended projects in the second half of the course can be quite overwhelming for some students. To make this transition easier, half of a session is dedicated to project planning techniques and setting achievable goals. The course handbook also includes project guidance, such as a list of beginner-friendly tutorial for popular APIs, instructions to work with files in Python, and how to safely deploy apps to the internet.

Learning to program can have a steep learning curve. Tools like the command-line can be a barrier to learning for some students .To overcome this issue the course uses PyCharm Community Edition. PyCharm provides many built-in tools making it easier for students to focus on learning to program. 

In summary, the updated course emphasises learning to program through problem solving; an essential skill in programming. With new reources and content the course is better suited and more accessible to students with different learning needs.
